# 🧠 SQL Data Analytics Project

A comprehensive collection of **SQL scripts** designed for **data exploration, analysis, and reporting**.  
This repository includes end-to-end queries to analyze dimensions, measures, trends, cumulative metrics, segmentation, and performance indicators in a **data warehouse environment**.

Each SQL file focuses on a **specific analytical objective** and adheres to **best practices** for performance, structure, and clarity — making it ideal for **data analysts, business intelligence developers, and SQL learners**.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project simulates a **Data Warehouse** built on SQL Server and follows a structured analytical workflow:

1. **Database Creation & Schemas**
   - Builds the `DataWarehouseAnalytics` database and `gold` schema.
   - Includes dimension and fact tables for products, customers, and sales.

2. **Exploration & Profiling**
   - Database, dimension, and date range exploration scripts.
   - Identifies key characteristics, unique values, and temporal ranges.

3. **Measures & KPIs**
   - Calculates key business metrics:
     - Total sales
     - Total quantity
     - Average price
     - Active customers
     - Average order revenue

4. **Advanced Analysis**
   - Year-over-year product performance.
   - Category contribution to overall sales.
   - Product segmentation and revenue ranking.
   - Monthly trends and cumulative performance analysis.

Each query has been **documented with professional headers**, **step-by-step logic**, and **inline comments** to ensure readability and compliance with **international SQL Server standards**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sql-data-analytics-project.git

2️⃣ Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Run the script 01_create_database.sql to create the database and load data.

Execute the other scripts in order to explore and analyze the data.

3️⃣ Review Outputs

Each script includes a clear analytical outcome (tables, aggregations, or KPIs).

🧠 Learning Goals

This project strengthens the following data analytics skills:

Data modeling (fact & dimension design)
